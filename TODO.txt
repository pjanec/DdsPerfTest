VISUALIZATION

Visualize samples from publishers of same class as a swarm of particles.

Each publisher = one particle drawn on a circle.
Angle on the circle derived from send time stamp of the last sample received.
Additional offset derived from publisher index (equidistant particles, offset = index*360/numParticles).

Healthy reception = particle smoothly moving along a circle.
Stop reception = particle static, not moving.
Missed update = visual jerk in smooth movement, bigger for more missed samples.
ReceptioDelays particle

Alternative reference ghost particle(s) having the angle derived from local time.
Reception latency as visual difference between ghost and non-ghost particle
(assumes synchronized system clock between publisher and subscriber).

Different swarms (one per message class) at different location in 3d world.
Mouse & keyboard controlled free camera. Quick jump to different swarms.


Different style of visualization for keyed instances of same msg class
 - one particle per instance
 - offset from rotating "grid" derived from instance index





Additional topic classes
 - Single instance, variable size topic
 - Multi-instance fixed size topic





Different interpretation of control values for producers of keyed instances
 - size = number of instances
 - rate = how often to update each instance
